A Diffusion Studio project: a video composition authored as code. The folder is
a plain npm package whose entry file is a [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com)
component; the app compiles it and renders every element into an editable node
on the canvas.

## Structure

| Path | What it is |
| ---- | ---------- |
| \`index.tsx\` | The entry. Its default export renders the composition. |
| \`package.json\` | The project record: \`projectId\` (its identity, kept across renames), \`displayName\` (the name shown in the app), \`main\` (the entry), \`diffusion\` (how each scene is exported), and the dapi commands as scripts. |
| \`tsconfig.json\` | Types for the composition tags, through \`jsxImportSource\`. |
| \`assets.yml\` | The asset library: for every asset its library path, where its bytes are, and what it was found to be. Written by the app; hand edits are read on the next load. |
| \`assets/\` | The library's files: put one here and it is taken in while the app watches, and the app writes its own here too — generations under \`assets/generated/\`. Media imported through the app is linked where it lies instead, never copied. |
| \`cache/\` | Derived data (thumbnails, waveforms). Disposable, and not checked in. |
| \`AGENTS.md\` | The agent entry point: what to read in \`.diffusion/docs/\` and how to work here. |
| \`.diffusion/\` | App-owned. \`docs/\` is the authoring reference and examples for the installed app version; the app regenerates it, and it is not checked in. |

## Authoring

The source is the document, in both directions. Saving recompiles the project
and remounts it — scenes rebuild in place, the way reloading a page does, and a
compile error leaves the last good render on the canvas. Edits made in the app
come back the other way: a dragged rect, a trimmed clip or a retyped line lands
as a prop on the element it was authored as.

\`\`\`tsx
export default function Project() {
  return (
    <stage background="#161616" camera={[0.3, 0, 0, 0.3, 85, 150]}>
      <scene name="Intro" width={1920} height={1080} fill="black" active>
        <video src="b-roll/drone.mp4" start={0} end={6} width={1920} height={1080} />
        <text y={860} width={1920} textAlign="center" fontFamily="Inter" fontSize={96} start={1} end={5}>
          Hello
          <animation type="fade" duration={0.5} />
          <animation type="fade" phase="out" duration={0.5} />
        </text>
      </scene>
    </stage>
  )
}
\`\`\`

- \`<stage>\` is the root, and holds one \`<scene>\` per frame you cut in. A scene
  owns the timeline its children sit on; nothing outside a scene has a clock to
  be placed against.
- One scene carries \`active\` — the one the playhead, the timeline and an export
  are pointed at — and the stage carries the \`camera\` the canvas opens on, a
  \`[scale, 0, 0, scale, x, y]\` matrix (\`0.3\` fits a 1920×1080 frame). Both are
  editor state: the app writes them back as the view is panned or a scene is
  clicked, but a project that ships without them opens on an empty timeline,
  looking at the corner of nothing.
- Position and size are explicit, in pixels. There is no layout pass and no CSS.
- \`start\` / \`end\` place a clip on that timeline, \`sourceIn\` / \`sourceOut\` choose
  the part of the media that plays. Times are seconds (\`1.5\`), frames (\`45f\`) or
  \`"MM:SS"\`.
- Style and motion are children: \`<animation>\` for a preset in or out,
  \`<keyframeTrack>\` with \`<keyframe>\` children for one property, \`<solidPaint>\`
  and the gradient paints, \`<stroke>\`, \`<shadow>\`, \`<effect>\`.
- \`src\` takes a library path (\`"b-roll/drone.mp4"\` — the portable form, it
  survives the file being relinked), an asset id, a URL, or an absolute path.
- Generated assets are declared rather than fetched: \`src={generate.image({ prompt })}\`,
  and \`generate.video\`, \`generate.voice\`, \`generate.audio\`. They are produced on
  mount, in dependency order. \`dapi context\` reports where each stands:
  generating, failed with the reason, or done with the asset path it landed as.
- Solid is fully available while mounting: \`<For>\`, \`<Show>\`, \`createMemo\`, and
  \`useTicker()\` for values that follow the playhead.
- npm packages work as they normally do. The folder is a real npm package, so
  \`npm i three\` in it is all it takes: anything in \`node_modules\` is resolved
  and bundled, subpath imports included. A composition runs in a browser
  context, so a package that needs Node APIs will not bundle.

Types are stripped at compile time and never checked, so typecheck the project
yourself with \`npx tsc --noEmit\`.

## Commands

Every dapi command is a script here: \`npm run\` lists them, and
\`npm run <name> -- <args>\` runs one (\`npm run grab -- b-roll/drone.mp4 -c 6\`).
All of them talk to the running app, except \`fonts\` and \`fetch\`.

| Script | Command | What it does |
| ------ | ------- | ------------ |
| \`open\` | \`dapi open .\` | Launch the app with this project open. |
| \`context\` | \`dapi context\` | Which project the app has open, where its playhead sits, its fonts, where its generations stand. |
| \`capture\` | \`dapi capture <id>\` | Render frames of a scene, as an export would, to labelled PNG contact sheets. |
| \`probe\` | \`dapi media probe <id\\|path>\` | Container and per-track metadata, without decoding. |

/**
 * The agent entry point, written once like the README: the file coding agents
 * load without being asked, and therefore the one place a project is reliably
 * discovered from. Loaded into context whole, so it stays a thin index into
 * `.diffusion/docs` rather than the docs themselves — and being the author's
 * file after the first write, an agent can append project conventions to it
 * while the paths it points at stay put.
 */
const AGENTS = `# Authoring this project

A Diffusion Studio project: a video composition authored as code. The entry
(\`index.tsx\`) default-exports a Solid component that renders a \`<stage>\`;
the app compiles it and renders every element into an editable node on the
canvas. The source is the document in both directions: saving recompiles and
remounts the project, and edits made in the app land back in the JSX as props
on the element they were authored as.

## Docs

\`.diffusion/docs/\` holds the authoring reference and runnable examples for
the installed app version. The app regenerates it on version changes: read it,
never edit it, and trust it over memory.

| Read | For |
| ---- | --- |
| \`.diffusion/docs/reference/jsx/README.md\` | The JSX contract — elements, props, pipeline. Start here. |
| \`.diffusion/docs/reference/jsx/timing.md\` | \`start\`/\`end\`/\`sourceIn\`/\`sourceOut\`, and the time formats. |
| \`.diffusion/docs/reference/jsx/generate.md\` | Declaring AI-generated assets (\`generate.*\`). |
| \`.diffusion/docs/reference/jsx/variables.md\` | \`@inspect\` variables: annotated consts as live inspector controls. |
| \`.diffusion/docs/reference/README.md\` | Every dapi command, its options and its output. |
| \`.diffusion/docs/examples/\` | Complete compositions, basics through shaders. |

## Working here

- Every dapi command is an npm script: \`npm run\` lists them, and
  \`npm run <name> -- <args>\` runs one.
- \`npm run context\` reports what the app has open, where its playhead sits,
  and where generations stand.
- Verify visually with \`npm run capture -- <sceneId>\`: it renders the
  scene's frames exactly as an export encodes them. Do not export a video to
  check work.
- Position and size are explicit, in pixels. There is no layout pass and no CSS.
- A composition you author from scratch marks one scene \`active\` and gives
  \`<stage>\` a \`camera\` framing it, or the project opens on an empty timeline
  with the frame off screen.
- Times are seconds (\`1.5\`), frames (\`"45f"\`), or \`"MM:SS"\`.
- Types are stripped at compile time, never checked: run \`npx tsc --noEmit\`.
`;
